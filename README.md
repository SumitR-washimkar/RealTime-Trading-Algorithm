# Real-Time Trading Pipeline: Kafka, Flink, Python, Data Lake

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Real-Time Trading Algorithm Pipeline**, combining event-driven and stream processing technologies for live financial analytics. It is designed to simulate a production-grade trading environment using:

- **Python (API Integration)** for extracting stock prices and market news
- **Kafka Redpanda** for real-time data streaming
- **Apache Flink** for preprocessing and real-time ML model execution
- **Slack/Custom UI** for live trading alerts
- **Data Lake** for storing historical data

## Architecture overview

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **`fetch_stock_data.py`**  
  - Collects real-time stock market data and financial news
  - Handles extraction from multiple data sources/APIs
- Located in: `ingestion/` folder

### Processing Environment
- **Docker-based infrastructure** (`docker-env/`)
  - Configuration files (`console-config.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`)
  - SQL client setup (`sql-client.sh`)
  - Containerized services for easy deployment
  - Includes Dockerfiles and entrypoint scripts

### Stream Processing
- **`flink-model/`**  
  - Preprocessing pipeline for raw data
- **`flink-python-model/`**  
  - Combines Flink's streaming capabilities with Python ML logic
  - Real-time analytics and feature engineering

### AI/ML Components
- **`models/`**  
  - Stores trained model artifacts
  - Integrated with Flink for real-time predictions
- Includes both preprocessing and inference logic

### Output Layer
- **`ui/`**  
  - API server and notification system for trading signals
- **`sink/`**  
  - Data Lake integration for storage and archival
  - Handles connection setup and data persistence
